# Image Stitcher
Python script written for class. Stitches a folder of images into a panorama using OpenCV.

A class was implemented in the file ![Image Stitcher](https://github.com/trombonee/image-stitcher/blob/main/Image_Stitcher.py) which has the ability to read a folder of images and assemble them into one output panoramic image. It makes use of OpenCV and NumPy to properly match, orient and stitch images without using the actual OpenCV stitcher class. 

This was part of a project for a machine vision course.
